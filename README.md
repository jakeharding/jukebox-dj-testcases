# Test Case for CSCI 4830
## Intro to Software Engineering Semester Project

The test cases are based on the Page Object design pattern.
This design pattern uses a class to describe the elements of the page.
The class also provides method to interact with the elements, enabling the test to be focused on assertions and verifications.
