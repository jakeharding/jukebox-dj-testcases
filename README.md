# Test Case for CSCI 4830
## Intro to Software Engineering Semester Project

The test cases are based on the Page Object design pattern.
This design pattern uses a class to describe the elements of the page.
The class also provides method to interact with the elements, enabling the test to be focused on assertions and verifications.

The tests require authentication. 
It is poor practice to commit a username and a password to a publicly available web application in a publicly available repository.
For these reasons a properties file is available to enter a username and password for the environment in which the tests will run.

##Please be sure to supply a username and password.
